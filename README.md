# Data Experiments and Practice

This repository brings together my practice exercises with datasets (mainly from Kaggle and open sources).
The goal is not to create portfolio projects, but to maintain the habit of working with data and exploring different Machine Learning and Data Engineering techniques.

## Structure
Each folder corresponds to a specific dataset or challenge:

Inside each folder, you will find:
- `notebook.ipynb`: main code for the exercise.
- `README.md`: brief explanation of the objective and the work done.

##  Repository Objective
- Maintain consistency in dataset management.
- Test new libraries and workflows.
- Document quick learnings that can serve as future reference.

## Note
This repository is for **personal practice**.
